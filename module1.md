### So What is a Kernel ? 
> A kernel is a piece of software which h talks to your hardware. Now apparently it does much more than that. 

## Distros.
> As Linux is an open source technology and anyone can change or customize things and create their own version. When this versions gets polished this results into distros. There are thousands of distro out their here are some the popular ones: 

> 1. [Red Hat.][www.redhat.org]  
> 1. [Ubuntu.][www.ubuntu.org] 
> 1. [Debian.][www.debian.org]  
> 1. [Arch.][www.archlinux.org]  
> 1. [Linux Mint.][www.archlinux.org]  

## Red Hat Linux:
> Red Hat linux is not a free though you can use fedora and get the same experience. This distribution is rock stable and is mainly used for servers. Fedora is just the free version of Red hat Linux. It uses RPM as it's package manager. 

## Debian:
> The debian operating system is one of the most stable distribution available in the Linux world. It is also one of the most used linux distribution. Majority of the distribution are based on this distro.\
***p.s:*** As many distros are based on debian including ubuntu thats the reason why it most used distro.

## Ubuntu:
> It is based on debian based operating system and is one of the most used distribution available on the planet. It has great community and almost has no learning curve when compared to others. As it is based on Debian it uses apt package manager. 

## Arch Linux:
> One of the most famous and beloved distribution in the Linux world. Arch Linux is very famous for its installation process and its KISS principle. This distribution is ran by almost every hardcore Linux user out there and that because of its AUR capabilities. Arch has one of the best wiki period and the community is quite helpful if you have done your research. 

***p.s:*** If you are new to linux this distro is not for you. I mean you can start from here but it has a learning curve which can make you sick. But the reward which you get is absolutely awesome which is `btw i use arch!!!`. 

## Linux Mint:
> If you are new to Linux and are migrating from windows then this might be the place for you to start. Linux mint offers windows like themeing which makes it very intuitive for the user to understand the workflow. It has a great community too.
