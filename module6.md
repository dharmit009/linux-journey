# Permissions: 

**How to list file permissions?**

The command which we use to list file permissions are `ls -l`. 
Here are a few more examples: 

drw-r--r-- 1 hmm hmm 4520 Dec  4 17:03 test

-rw-r--r-- 1 hmm hmm 4520 Dec  4 17:03 module3.md

-rw-r--r-- 1 hmm hmm 2240 Dec  9 13:32 systeminfo.md

-rwxr--r-- 1 hmm hmm 2240 Dec  9 13:32 hello.sh 

The permissions are divided into different parts mainly into 

1. Directory or a file.
1. User Permissions.
1. Group Permissions.
1. Others Permissions.

## Character Representation For Each Permission: 

1. -: empty.
1. r: read. 
1. w: write. 
1. x: execute. 
1. d: directory.

## Modifying Permissions: 

To modify permissions we use the command `chmod`.
